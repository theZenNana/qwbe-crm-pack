# Jev scores under 70 after the move to Effect (documented exceptions)

Measured 2026-09-27 between 17:00 and 21:15 with the owner's Jev scorer after each agent run
that wrote code, on three rubrics: ponytail (lean code), unslop (plain prose) and srp (single
responsibility). Latest score per file and rubric. 77 files scored; 33 have at least one score
under 70. No unslop score is under 70.

The owner allowed exceptions (2026-09-27: every file above 70, exceptions where needed). These
are to fix in a later refactor. Jev varies between runs of the same file: the Jev refactor
round measured `tools/vtiger/vtiger-map.ts` at 62.6 in its own session while the recorded score
of the same file is 35.9; treat single numbers as noisy and rescore before acting on one.

Patterns on this branch (the same as the kernel's stage 2-5 exceptions):
- Entry files of the CLI tools score low on srp: the entry wires argv, config, the API session
  and the stages. They are already split into `-pure.ts` decisions and one-domain I/O modules
  (`-api.ts`, `-prepare.ts`, `-db.ts`, `-counts.ts`); splitting further raises srp and lowers
  depth.
- Scenario tests and live checks score low on srp: one file holds setup, the scenario and its
  assertions, by design (one purpose: one scenario).
- ponytail under 70 is `lean` / `every_part_needed` on files between 60 and 130 lines.
- `tools/demo/seed-demo-wipe.ts` and `seed-demo.ts`, `tools/vtiger/vtiger-export.ts`: ponytail
  `loses_data_on_error`. The wipe deletes only `demo:*` rows and a rerun of the seed rebuilds
  them; the export writes to `.local/vtiger-export` and a rerun overwrites. No customer data is
  lost; left as is.
