// The ORGANIZATIONS cube — the Organization, third child of the CRM plugin.
//
// Domain: an ORGANIZATION is the company a business deals with. This is the entity the vtiger
// users worked in all day (about 60 thousand rows), rebuilt here as a photograph of the vtiger
// standard fields that actually carry data — not a one-to-one copy. What is empty or
// vtiger-internal stays out: no `notify_owner`, no `modifiedby` mirrors (EntityMeta already
// carries createdAt), no parent-to-parent hierarchy (explicitly out of scope), and no custom
// fields (those are a separate system, not this ticket).
//
// One name everywhere: the cube, its route, its table, its permissions,
// its command and its event are all "organizations". The relation to contacts has ONE truth:
// `Contact.organizationId`. It lives on the contact, it is nullable, and an organization's
// contact list is derived by filtering contacts on it. This cube does not hold a contacts list
// and does not import the contacts cube — neither names the other.
//
// Money: vtiger's `annualrevenue` is a bare integer with no currency. A number that looks like
// money without saying which money is the exact defect the contracts cube refuses, so the field
// stays out until it can be carried with a currency, in minor units.
//
// Ids: opaque strings with the prefix `org`, same naming spirit as every sibling.
// The schemas live in ./schema.ts (size cap: split, not raise).
