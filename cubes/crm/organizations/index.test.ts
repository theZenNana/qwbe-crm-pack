// Compile-time contract tests for the organizations cube (QWB-47, renamed QWB-54 ticket 12).
//
// What is proven here, without a server: the cube is a valid `defineCube` product (manifest
// sane, handlers exactly matching endpoints — checked by the kernel's own validators), the
// domain decisions are visible in the manifest and schemas, and handlers enforce permissions
// and 404 on the typed seam. Runtime HTTP proof lives in probes/crm.mjs.
//
// Run from the Qwbe layout (plugin installed at core/plugins/crm-pack/cubes/crm):
//   cd <qwbe>/core && node --test plugins/crm-pack/cubes/crm/organizations/index.test.ts
