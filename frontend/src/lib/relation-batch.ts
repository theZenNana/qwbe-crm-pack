// round-trips before anything on the page was readable. qwbe's list contract
// takes `ids=a,b,c` and sizes the batch by the ids themselves
// (qwbe core/src/kernel/list.ts: `ids=` is a batch, not a page), so one
// request per DISTINCT TARGET CUBE resolves every relation cell on the page.
//
// Pure derivation only: the fetch lives in the hook (use-relation-titles) and
// the components. Everything here is testable without a DOM or a backend.
