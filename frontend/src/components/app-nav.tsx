// The bar every signed-in page carries: where you are, where else you can go, and the way out.

// Without it the app was a dead end -- login landed on the identity page and nothing linked to the
// lists, so the only way to reach them was to type the URL. The entries are the app's routes, not
// the cubes: a new cube gets a page when someone writes one, and that page adds itself here.
//
// It renders from the root layout, so a page added later carries the bar without doing anything,
// and the detail pages get it too. The signed-out pages are the exception, listed below.
