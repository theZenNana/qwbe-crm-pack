// Two copies exist after an official install: the store shelf (core/store/crm-pack, carrying
// its qwbe-source.json provenance) and the installed destination (core/plugins/crm-pack,
// which strips the manifest and the provenance as bookkeeping). The shelf is judged by the
// kernel's own drift function - the one `qwbe drift` runs - plus one pack-side rule the
// kernel cannot know: the shelf must have been staged from THIS repo, never from a scratch
// copy (a /tmp staging is how the drift happened). The destination is decided by
// fingerprint against the repo minus the stripped bookkeeping files. Exit 1 on any red: a
// stale copy above this repo makes every verdict about this pack false. An absent copy is
// not drift - the pack is simply not installed there.
